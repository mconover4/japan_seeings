# Japan Seeings

## Description

Japan Seeings is a web application to store every spot of Japan you've been to, similar to a to-do list.
Users can keep track of the places they visited, rate them, comment and keep them organized for reference and to share with this community.
Any user that joins can see what and where other users have been to and what they thought of that particular spot, but this app doesn't display who said what. It's not about bragging or popularity, it's plain old information gathering from other users like you with the same interest in Japan as a tourist spot.
It's pretty simple and that is part of the point. It's easy to fill your board with all the spots you hit and go back to edit them later, if you need to.

## Usage

To use this app, just clone, run `rake db:migrate` and then run `shotgun`.
Everything should be set up.
